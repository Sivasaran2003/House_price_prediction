- Took a raw dataset from kaggle with outliers, irregular and inconsistent data. (source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data)
- Carried out preprocessing techniques like one hot encoding and removed outliers
- performed visualization to view the outliers
- did feature engineering and dimensionality reduction
- implemented GridSearchCV to select the Best Model our Lasso, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor

**Technologies needed :**
